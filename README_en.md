# C++ Template Singly Linked List Class

I am a C++ beginner. This is a **template-based singly linked list** I wrote during my learning process.  
It contains extensive Doxygen comments and has an HTML webpage generated by Doxygen.  
See `./docs/html/index.html` for details.  
Suitable for beginners to learn from, and also welcome suggestions from experts.

**I apologize in advance**
Due to my limited personal capabilities, basically only this file has an English version
However, you may use a browser translation plugin or other tools
Thank you for your understanding

## Basic Introduction
- Exception-safe, throws exceptions when needed
- Provides iterators and const iterators
- Template-based, can store any type
- Supports move semantics
- Supports range-based for loops

## Usage
Include directly:
```cpp
#include "LinkedList.hpp"
```
Usage example:
```cpp
// basic_usage.cpp
...
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>
#include "../LinkedList.hpp"
using std::cout;
using std::string;
...
template<typename T>
void printList(LinkedList<T> l) { // list
        for(auto it = l.cbegin(); it != l.cend(); ++it) {
                cout << *it << " ";
        }
        cout << "\n";
}
...
int main() {
        ...
        LinkedList<int> ml; // myList
        ml.push_back(1);
        ml.push_back(3);
        ml.insert(1, 2);
        ml.push_front(0);
        printList(ml); // 0 1 2 3
        auto ml2(std::move(ml));
        ml2.erase(2);
        ml2.pop_back();
        printList(ml2); // 0 1
        
        LinkedList<string> sl; // stringList
        for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                sl.push_back("n");
        }
        for(auto& s : sl) {
                s = string(sl.size(), 'b');
        }
        printList(sl); // bbbbbbbbbb ...
        for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                sl[i] = string(sl.size(), 'c');
        }
        printList(sl); // cccccccccc ...
        ...
        return 0;
}
```
The above code is already compiled and located in ./bin/.
Executable format: Linux

If you want to compile it yourself:
***C++ version: >=11***

```console
~/examples/ $ g++ basic_usage.cpp -o basic_usage
```

Then run:

```console
~/examples/ $ ./basic_usage
```

Due to personal environment limitations, only Linux executables are provided. Sorry for the inconvenience.

About the API

You have two options to view it:

· Read the source code directly (recommended for Chinese-speaking beginners)
    Benefits:
  1. Comments are quite clear (I think so)
  2. The source code is right there
  3. The Doxygen-generated documentation is in English, and machine translation may not be ideal  
· Read the Doxygen-generated documentation (recommended for experts)
  But I still recommend reading the source code.

Finally

If you find issues or have ideas,
feel free to share your feedback in the Issues section.
